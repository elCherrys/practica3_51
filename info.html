                Irithyll of the boreal valley
            </h3>
            <p>
                Irithyll of the Boreal Valley is known to be an ancient city. It is difficult to say when exactly it was built, but what is known for sure is that it is that it did exist during Gwyn's first age of fire and it was home to nobles who worshiped the moon and supported Gwyndolin. At some point, the sorcerer Sulyvahn passed through it to get to Anor Londo, the city of the gods, and begin to usurp their kingdom. After his plan had been unfolded and the royal family was either exiled or imprisoned, Irithyll was shut off from the rest of the world. Sulyvahn blocked the entrance to the city with a spell to ensure that the only one who would be able to return was Aldrich, when he was resurrected as a lord. He did this by making it so that only those holding a small doll, which was Aldrich's possession, could go through the fog wall. Most of the old nobles who resided in the city were enslaved and corrupted by either the deep and darkness of the abyss, the profaned flame and the fire witches or the beasthood which Sulyvahn forced upon them. Sulyvahn, now a Pontiff resides within the old cathedral.

                Anor Londo
            </h3>
            <p>
                In the Age of Fire, Anor Londo was the "City of Gods" where Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight once ruled. Gwynevere and Gwyndolin, the children of Gwyn, also lived here.In the times of the kingdom of Lothric, things have changed. The beautiful city that once had a glowing sunlight is now cold and dark; the cathedral where the Chosen Undead once fought Ornstein and Smough is now corrupted by the Deep and the home to Gwyndolin, who took his father's title of King of the Gods but fell ill; and the chamber that once held Gwynevere now has nothing but the Sun Princess Ring. A denizen that came from the Painted World, Sulyvahn, infiltrated the city of Irithyll and Gwyndolin's Covenant and later proclaimed himself Pontiff. When Gwyndolin fell ill and became incapable of leading the city and the Covenant, he was forced to retire in the cathedral. The leadership passed to Captain Yorshka, Gwyndolin's crossbreed sister, who was immediately imprisoned by Sulyvahn. Sulyvahn converted Irithyll's knights to the worship of the Deep. The Pontiff then lead his master and Saint of the Deep, Aldrich, to devour the helpless Gwyndolin.

                Manus was a primordial human. The people of Oolacile were fooled by a serpent â€” presumably Kaathe â€” to excavate Manus's grave, which incited his wrath. This caused his humanity to go wild, leading to the creation of the Abyss. Manus went mad, eternally seeking his precious Broken Pendant.

            <p>
                A descendant of the Archdragons and raised by the gods themselves, Midir was tasked with fighting against the abyss and its creations. His immortality enables him to perform his duties without end, even after the gods have long since perished. But his task has rendered him damaged beyond repair, as the dark has seeped into him and infected him (his title implies that he actually consumed potent sources of dark), and forms black crystals. It is not exactly clear whether or not he has been fully consumed, but he clearly feels the effects, able to use the dark in combat.
